          <p class="ai-advantages__text fade-down delay-2">Growth came relatively quickly after OpenApplyâ€™s initial launch, and the founder was soon inundated with issues related to product expansion, emerging bugs within the code, and a user interface that had quickly become outdated.</p>
          <p class="ai-advantages__text fade-down delay-2">We were hired to debug the product, develop an entirely new user interface, create additional features, and streamline their internal project management processes. Because of our success, they also asked us to build their internal development department in Ukraine.</p>
